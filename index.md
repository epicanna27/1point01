## Welcome to x1.01 (also known as 1point01)

x1.01 is a game about multiplication and exponentially increasing numbers.  You start with A set to 1, and B set to 1.01.  Every click multiplies A by B, and makes that the new A.  The result?  Exponentially increasing A.

It's more than just that.  Every time that A reaches at least 1 googol (that's a 1 followed by 100 zeroes), it resets back to 1 and B increases by 0.01.  So the next time, you'll be multiplying by 1.02 and it will go much, much faster!

If you're a normal human being, you won't need to read any more.  Most people aren't going to accept this challenge, but you can read on if you think you may be up for it.  So here goes: you've also got C, the change in B.  C starts at 0.01.  If for whatever reason you manage to get B to a googol, then you change C by 0.01 and reset B.  So at that point, instead of B increasing as 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, it goes 1.02, 1.04, 1.06!  If you have even more time on your hands, you can even go up to D, E, and the rest of the alphabet, with D being the change in C, E being the change in D, and so on.  Y is the last one that goes like this - once you get Y to a googol, you have officially BEATEN THE GAME.  That's going to take a long time.

So, what's Z?  Good question.  Z is how many times you've beaten the game.  It starts at 0.  Then you get Y to a googol and it's 1.  The ultimate challenge?  Get Z to a googol.  Just kidding.  Actually, not really kidding.
